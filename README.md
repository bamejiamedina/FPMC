# FPMC
Short python script to solve for all full-period, modulus-compatible multipliers for a given multiplier m. In this case, m = 32,749, which is the highest prime number less than 2^16 - 1, so this multiplier supports up to 16-bit multipliers. This can be edited to be compatible with other machines such as 32-bit/64-bit.
